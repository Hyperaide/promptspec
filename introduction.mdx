### What is PromptSpec?
PromptSpec is a YAML-based configuration standard that provides a clear, concise, and flexible way to define AI prompts. This specification is designed to be universally adaptable, allowing for seamless integration with different AI models and services. 

### Key Features
- **Structured Prompt Definition**: Clearly define AI prompts with standardized fields for inputs, outputs, and contextual information.
- **Model Agnostic**: Compatible with various AI models, including but not limited to OpenAI's offerings.
- **Conditional Logic**: Use expressions to create dynamic prompts that change based on input.
- **Test Cases**: Embed test cases within your PromptSpec, facilitating automated testing and quality assurance.

### Benefits
- **Standardization**: PromptSpec offers a uniform method for defining AI prompts, facilitating their creation, sharing, and reuse across various projects and teams.
- **Flexibility**: With tools like Helicone, you can easily modify the prompt URL in the specification for seamless observability.
- **Integration with Codebase**: All files reside in your codebase, ensuring they are tracked by git and are easily manageable in code editors. The structured format enhances AI autocomplete functionality, making it more comprehensible for Language Models.


### Basic Example
```yaml character.yaml
version: 1.2
name: "Character AI"
description: "Responds like the person the user wants the AI to act like."

parameters:
  type: object
  properties:
    character:
      type: string
      description: "The character's name"

  messages:
    - role: "system"
      content: "You are {character}. Respond to every message like {character} would."
```
